# Calcium_likelihoods

Package dependencies may cause issues so use the environment file environment.yml. Code to import environment variable in conda is

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Environment name is "ca_like". The jupyter notebook example files will show the calcium likelihood in use for latent dynamical models.
